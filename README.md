# Bookshelf

This webapp was created for the Udemy Complete Web Development Boot Camp by Angela Yu for the "Book Notes" Capstone Project.

*Bookshelf* is a simple web app that uses the CRUD method to keep a record of books that you've read, and allows you to associate the following data with each book: rating, notes, and date read.  

Open Library is the chosen API for this project: https://openlibrary.org/developers/api

### The project showcases the following skills:
- Front-end (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- Use of a public API
- Express/Node.js for server-side programming
- Demonstrate ability to Create Read Update and Delete data in a PostgreSQL Database to persist data.
